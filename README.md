## Mood Board

Firstly, to get a clear idea of what I wanted the portfolio to feel and look like overall I resorted to a moodboard for brainstorming. This allowed me to set the overall vibe the website presented as I continue developing it.

I wanted the aesthetic to be similar to the websites my target audience would spend a lot of time on like GitHub or API documentation sites like Stripe. I know many techinical people at software companies, including myself, prefer dark mode similar to GitHub's default theme. Therefore I decided to go witha dark theme with a great contrasting primary color.
